# welcome! we are [studio simpatico](https://studiosimpati.co/).

We are a collaborative, consultative creative studio based in New York City specializing in [web design](https://studiosimpati.co/services/web-design-new-york-nyc/), [UX design](https://studiosimpati.co/services/product-ux-design-agency-new-york/), and [WordPress development](https://studiosimpati.co/services/wordpress-custom-web-development/).

We build fully custom, bespoke WordPress themes from the ground up using Advanced Custom Fields (ACF). We value easy-to-maintain, intuitively organized, and well-annotated user interfaces within the WordPress admin area.

While we are not working on designing brands, visual identities, websites, and custom themes for our wonderful clients, we are building tools to make content creation and editing more intuitive, seamless, and powerful. 

We are currently nerding out on:
- **building** a customizable WordPress admin experience with flexibility, accessibility, and personalization
- **exploring** how to easily migrate *one* page between environments in a non-Gutenberg environment
- **creating** an easy-to-use starter WordPress theme with modularity at its core
- **thinking** about building in Gutenberg versus the "classic" editor + ACF, and the balancing act of modular/block-based page creation and editing
- **developing** blazingly fast and simple-to-use JavaScript add-ons for animations & interactions using modern web APIs
